Standalone .exe — no injector needed, run as admin and spawn.  
Works on latest HumanitZ (Update 1.0+ patches, BattlEye active).

Why this hack survives BattlEye in 2026  
- Simple: .exe → HumanitZ → auto-load  
- Humanized closet: smoothing, FOV limits, vis checks  
- Kernel BattlEye bypass — streamproof overlays  
- ESP: players, zombies, loot, vehicles, bases, stashes  
- Updates post-patch/wipe  
- No key/sub — loader style  
- Windows 10/11 64-bit (Steam)
